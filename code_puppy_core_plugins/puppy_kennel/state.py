"""Runtime state for the puppy_kennel plugin.

Single source of truth for whether the kennel is on. Flipped by the
``/kennel enable`` and ``/kennel disable`` slash commands. Persisted in
``puppy.cfg`` under the key ``kennel_enabled`` so the front end can read
and write the same value.

Default is **enabled** -- a missing key, blank value, or garbage value
all leave the kennel on. Only the explicit-falsy tokens
``{"false", "0", "no", "off"}`` (case-insensitive) turn it off. That
asymmetry is on purpose: on a default-on system, a typo like
``kennel_enabled = noep`` must not silently kill memory. In the face of
ambiguity, refuse to guess.

Reads and writes go through ``code_puppy.config.get_value`` /
``set_config_value``, the same helpers every other plugin (statusline,
prompt_newline, ...) uses for puppy.cfg interop.
